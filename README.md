# CodeWars
This is a collection of my coding solutions from the coding platform <em>CodeWars</em>.

A link to my profile can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/jwhudnall)

The notebook also includes alternate solutions proposed by the community, along with my drilling down to better understand these methods.

### Structure
Each coding challenge is called a 'kata'. Each kata has the following sections:
* Name
* Difficulty
* Instructions
* Sample Tests
* Solution
